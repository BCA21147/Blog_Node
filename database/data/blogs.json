Do you like travelling across the globe and exploring various cuisines? Then this food blogging style is for you! It still has a lot of potential target audience, as it hasn’t been fully explored yet! To put it better, this food blogging style can be compared to a gold mine which has still not been dug up! There is no reason why your food blog can’t pay you back when you adopt this style. It helps spread awareness about ancestral culinary customs and traditions. For instance, let’s say that you grew up in a Gujarati household. You might remember some authentic yet lip-smackingly delicious recipes prepared by your grandma. Did those recipes involve any traditional cooking hacks? It’s time to explore and promote your culture through food!",

Examples like 1898’s Shinin No Sosei (Resurrection of a Corpse) come to mind, as well as several early horror iterations across the globe that captured the imagination of an audience hungry for creepy, occult fun.

As far back as the Renaissance and the Enlightenment period, the development of what we call science today began influencing art and culture. It took it a while to fully integrate, and by the time the cinematic arts rolled around, audiences everywhere were ready to add “science fiction” to the types of genres they wanted to see.  Science fiction films are ostensibly about the future, when we’ve developed the technology to travel between stars, travel back in time, or pull off other technological marvels.  Of course, though, that notion is just an affectation. Science fiction stories take the social, cultural, political, and technological issues that we’re facing today and project them into a fictional future, where we can get a good look at them. Fear, awe, excitement, and hope are all hallmarks of the science fiction genre, which does a great job of showing its audiences what they aren’t noticing about their lives right now.",

  "blog_description": "A case study is a great piece of content to have under your belt. It enhances your reputation in the market. Data and statistics provided in a case study build your credibility as a brand.  You can link a case study to a relevant blog to prove a point. Once you’ve written an authentic case study, say, about a client who got 10,000 website visits through backlinks. You can link that easily to a blog titled, ‘5 ways to get website visitors through backlinks’.  If you link a case study to an appropriate blog - where it doesn’t seem forced – more readers will click on it.",
